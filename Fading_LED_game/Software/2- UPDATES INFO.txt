v1.0:
- There are two red leds that keep fading slowly from 100% to 0%
- There are two groups of 4 leds around the two buttons but they're fixed.
- The point of the game is to test the reflexes between two players or by yourself.
  To win, you have to press the button when the red led are at 100% or 0% brightness.
  When someone of the two win, the loser player side shuts off and the one who won,
  starts blinking for a few secs.
  After this, the game starts again but with the red leds fading even faster.
  The two players have to try again with the game being even faster.
  This game have no end.
