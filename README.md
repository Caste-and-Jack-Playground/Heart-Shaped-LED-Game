# Heart-Shaped-LED-Game
This game can be played both alone or with a friend (maybe even a lover). The goal is to press the button when the red leds brightness is at its minimum or maximum. When you win, your leds will blink. Then you'll get to the next level where the leds will fade on and off even faster.
