# Heart-Shaped-LED-Game
This cute game will test your reflexes and rythm.\
It's pretty easy to use, there are just two buttons for two players.
The goal is to press the button when the leds on the top are at their maximum or minimum brightness.\
When you win, the leds on your side will blink.\
Then you'll get to the next level where the leds will fade on and off even faster.\
This game can be played alone, with a friend or maybe even a lover.
