# Heart-Shaped-LED-Game
This game can be played alone, with a friend or maybe even a lover.
The goal is to press the button when the leds on the top are at their maximum or minimum brightness.
When you win, the leds on your side will blink.
Then you'll get to the next level where the leds will fade on and off even faster.
